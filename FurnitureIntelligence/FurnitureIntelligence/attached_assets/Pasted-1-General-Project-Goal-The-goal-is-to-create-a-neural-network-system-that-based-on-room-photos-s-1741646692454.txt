1. General Project Goal
The goal is to create a neural network system that, based on room photos, specified dimensions, room classification, budget, and user style preferences, generates optimal furniture arrangement options. Additionally, the system should:

Provide recommendations in the form of text hints (using a lightweight language model).
Generate layout drawings or visualizations.
Integrate with external services via API (e.g., for retrieving product information, purchase links, etc.).
2. Functional Requirements
User Data Input:
Photos of the room from different angles.
Room dimensions (length, width, height, layout).
Room classification (kitchen, living room, bedroom, office, etc.).
Budget and stylistic preferences.
Data Processing:
Image analysis to identify key objects and interior features.
Semantic segmentation and 3D reconstruction of the interior (using datasets such as ScanNet, Structured3D, Matterport3D).
Integration with product databases to select relevant items (e.g., Amazon data).
Recommendation Generation:
Selection of furniture options based on budget and style.
Providing purchase links (via external service APIs).
Generating text-based design improvement suggestions (using a pre-trained language model).
Visualization:
Generating layout drawings or 3D visualizations of furniture arrangement.
Ability to edit or refine the generated design.
API Integration:
Interaction with external services (stores, CAD systems, 3D visualization platforms).
3. Technical Requirements
Image Processing Module:
Use of convolutional neural networks for interior image analysis and segmentation.
3D reconstruction based on input data (depth maps, photogrammetry).
Recommendation System:
Algorithms for finding similar interiors and optimal furniture placement, considering stylistic, budgetary, and functional parameters.
Integration with external product databases.
Language Model:
Lightweight NLP model for generating advice and answering user questions.
Ability to fine-tune the model with interior design-specific data.
Visualization Module:
Tools for generating drawings or 3D models (potential integration with CAD solutions).
User interface for interactive viewing and editing of recommendations.
API Integration:
Development of a RESTful API for communication with external services.
Ensuring security and scalability of the API.
Platform & Infrastructure:
Deployment capability on cloud services.
Support for scalability and high load capacity as the number of users grows.
4. Implementation Stages
Research & Data Collection:
Finding and analyzing datasets (SUN RGB-D, NYU Depth V2, ScanNet, Matterport3D, Structured3D, 3D-FUTURE, ShapeNet, product datasets).
Prototype Development:
Creating a basic version for image processing and recommendation generation.
Visualization Module Development:
Integration with CAD/3D tools for creating drawings.
API Integration:
Establishing connections with external services.
Testing & Debugging:
Verifying the correct functionality of all modules.
Launch & Feedback Collection:
Gradual system deployment with subsequent optimization.
5. Expected Results
Functionality:
The system should process photos, consider specified parameters, and provide optimal layouts with visualizations and purchase links.
Integration:
Support for API connections with external data sources.
Usability:
An intuitive interface for data upload and result viewing.
Scalability:
The ability to improve and expand functionality based on user feedback.
